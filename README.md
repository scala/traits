# Traits

A tracker for notable changes to Scala as they move through their lifecycle —
from an idea or pre-SIP discussion, through the
[SIP process](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/process-specification.html), into
the compiler as experimental → preview → stable, and eventually to deprecated
and removed. It answers, for any change: *where does this stand, in which Scala
version, and how do I use it?*

**[`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) is the design document** — what the app tracks, the
lifecycle, the data model, the views. Read it first.

## Running it

Prerequisites: JDK 17+, sbt, Node.

```bash
sbt backend/run                              # serves /api on :8080

cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev    # in another terminal
# open http://localhost:5173 — /api is proxied to :8080
```

`sbt backend/run` sets `TRAITS_ENV=dev`, which supplies dev defaults for
`TRAITS_EDITOR_PASSWORD` (`let-me-in`), `TRAITS_SESSION_SECRET` and
`TRAITS_DB_PATH`. A packaged jar has no fallbacks and requires them explicitly;
the other variables are `TRAITS_HTTP_PORT`, `TRAITS_DB_POOL_SIZE` and
`TRAITS_STATIC_FILES` (see `Config.scala`).

For a production build, `cd frontend && npm run build` emits `frontend/dist`,
which the backend serves as static files.

The store starts empty and is never seeded — deleting `traits-data/traits.sqlite*`
loses its contents for good.

## Modules

| Module     | Platform | Package root                    | What it holds                                              |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shared`   | JVM + JS | `org.scalalang.traits.shared`   | Domain model, tapir `Endpoints`, `Schemas`, `ApiError`      |
| `backend`  | JVM      | `org.scalalang.traits.backend`  | Netty-sync server, SQLite/Magnum store, auth, OpenAPI docs  |
| `frontend` | JS       | `org.scalalang.traits.frontend` | Laminar SPA: board, SIP board, entry, versions, editor      |

Both sides depend on `shared`, so the HTTP shape can't drift between them.

Storage is a single SQLite file holding each entry as a JSON document. Reads are
public; writes are gated by a shared password exchanged for a signed session
cookie. There is no LLM in the server — curation is done by pointing a coding
agent at the HTTP API.
